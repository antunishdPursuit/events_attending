                <li>Backend: Node.js with Express.js</li>
                <li>Database: PSQL for efficient data storage</li>
                <li>External APIs: Ticketmaster API for event searching</li>
                <li>Deployment: Hosted the backend on Render and frontend on Netlify</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Features Implemented</h3>
